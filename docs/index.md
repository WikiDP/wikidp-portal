## Wikidata for Digital Preservation
Members of the digital preservation community collate and capture metadata to describe file formats, software, operating systems and hardware, and use it to inform and drive digital preservation processes. The vision of Wikidata for Digital Preservation is to use Wikidata as a technical registry of metadata related to computer software and computing environments. Collaboratively creating this metadata, and making it available as linked open data, will reduce the amount of redundant work digital preservation professionals do in order to describe resources. Having machine-readable, linked open data that describes the digital preservation domain will also allow us to reuse this data in our software applications and information systems, reducing the overhead when building new tools.

## Where Can I Find Information to cite? 

### Connecting file formats and software

We need to create statements on software items using property [readable file format](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1072) and [writable file format](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1072) to indicate relationships with file formats.

This information is available from the software itself. It is also sometimes described in the user manual or on a website about the software.
#### Reference example
This is an item with relatively complete information about how it relates to file formats: [GIMP image processing software](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8038).

### Leverage external ids
Many software and file format items have identifiers in external systems. These external systems may contain information about the resources you're looking to describe.
#### Video Game Developer example
The Moby Games resource has detailed descriptions about many companies that develop software, especially games.

If you find an item for a software developer that does not yet have many statements, you may be able to create additional statements from the info on the Moby Games site.

Follow the link from the value for [MobyGames company ID](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P4773) on the item for the developer to see the Moby Games page for the company. Thank you for making the information in Wikidata more complete! 

Here is a SPARQL query to find all Wikidata items that have a statment using [MobyGames company ID](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P4773). Copy the text of the query and paste it into the [Wikidata Query Service SPARQL endpoint](https://query.wikidata.org).
